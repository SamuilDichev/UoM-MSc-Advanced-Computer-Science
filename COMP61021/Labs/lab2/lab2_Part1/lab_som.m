function som = lab_som (trainingData, neuronCount, trainingSteps, startLearningRate, startRadius)
% som = lab_som (trainingData, neuronCount, trainingSteps, startLearningRate, startRadius)
% -- Purpose: Trains a 1D SOM i.e. A SOM where the neurons are arranged
%             in a single line. 
%             
% -- <trainingData> data to train the SOM with
% -- <som> returns the neuron weights after training
% -- <neuronCount> number of neurons 
% -- <trainingSteps> number of training steps 
% -- <startLearningRate> initial learning rate
% -- <startRadius> initial radius used to specify the initial neighbourhood size

% TODO:
% The student will need to complete this function so that it returns
% a matrix 'som' containing the weights of the trained SOM.
% The weight matrix should be arranged as follows, where
% N is the number of features and M is the number of neurons:
%
% Neuron1_Weight1 Neuron1_Weight2 ... Neuron1_WeightN
% Neuron2_Weight1 Neuron2_Weight2 ... Neuron2_WeightN
% ...
% NeuronM_Weight1 NeuronM_Weight2 ... NeuronM_WeightN
%
% It is important that this format is maintained as it is what
% lab_vis(...) expects.
%
% Some points that you need to consider are:
%   - How should you randomise the weight matrix at the start?
%   - How do you decay both the learning rate and radius over time?
%   - How does updating the weights of a neuron effect those nearby?
%   - How do you calculate the distance of two neurons when they are
%     arranged on a single line?
