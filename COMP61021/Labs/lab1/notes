PCs are essentially vectors which define a vector space, i.e. the space where points reside.

On a 2D space, the X and Y axises would normally be these vectors which define the vector space. But PCs essentially point in the directions of the least covariance (Or something like that). 

To visualise it, imagine points in a graph, which stretch in a particular direction. The first PC might be in that direction. If I understand correctly, whether a PC is first or second depends on the covariance. Sot it's kinda of like ranking.
